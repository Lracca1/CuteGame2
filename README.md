CuteGame!

Deep Dive Coding Java Android Salesforce Cohort 4

Aims and Motivations
 I chose to develop this particular app because I was always interested on how games were made and decided to try and build one myself. 
 I believe this could be a potentially useful entertainment app. Everyone gets bored and/or stressed at least once in their lifetime. 
 So with that being said,  if people just want to distract themselves from boredom, homework, work, or anything else that they need escape 
 from for a moment, they can play this game. 

Current State
 1.) There is a game going but there isn't any creams to get points. I couldn't get the creams to randomly show up or even just show up one 
 time on the screen. 
 2.) The sign in button doesnt work yet. It needs a lot of work.
